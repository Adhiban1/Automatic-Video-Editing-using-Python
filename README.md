# Automatic Video Editing using Python
First move or copy your video into the `video` folder inside `Video editor 1.0` folder and audio to `Video editor 1.0\audio`.

Go to `Video editor 1.0\clips.txt`

```
0:38-0:48
0:53-1:00
1:07-1:16
audio-1:03
```
Like this type the `timestamps` that you want and `audio shift`

`audio shift` - starting timestamp of the audio.

After filling the time for both video and audio. Then double click run bat file.

Then python output the `final video` at `Video editor 1.0\output\final.mp4`.

Then move this `final.mp4` video to `Automatic Video editing\video`. Make sure this `final.mp4` should be the lenth of less then or equal to 5 minutes.

If your `final.mp4` length increases then python will take more time exponentially.

Then double click `Automatic Video editing\run.bat`

At cmd, it asks the starting time (in seconds) and ending time (in second) from the `final.mp4`.

Then python will create 10 videos at `Automatic Video editing\output`.

These videos are generated by selecting sub clips of the `final.mp4` video and shuffling the clips and adding the audio that located in `Automatic Video editing\audio`.

Check these 10 video. Some videos are not good some videos are good. Take the video that you like.
